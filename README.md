![1](phase.png) Why there are so many things that go through phase change? Why things are not linear? Maybe of all the contributing factors, one of them is the more important than does the others?

- 统计滤波会根据随机过程建模去解构不确定性；控制工程会通过微分方程建模去描述一个动态系统。这些建模的思维方法训练过程长，对抽象思维要求高，是值得花时间打磨的技能。
- Reduce the problem to its simplest form and go from there. Think about the performance over extreme condictions. Can we decompose a complicated system? Can we hedge for the undesirable part?

- [Neural Point Process for Learning Spatiotemporal Event Dynamics](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v168/zhou22a/zhou22a.pdf) How to incorporate neural point process into the MOT framework?

- [Nocturne: a scalable driving benchmark for bringing multi-agent learning one step closer to the real world](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09889) This might be a simulator that I can use for the experiments.

- There are two ways to incorporate contingency planning into MPC based planning. One, MPC can be [multi-model and branched](http://ames.caltech.edu/chen2021interactive.pdf). Two, Multi-Hypothesis Tracking and Multi-Scenario MPC based Planning. Not that many people are aware of the MHT issue, so that is another way to use multi-scenario MPC based planning.
